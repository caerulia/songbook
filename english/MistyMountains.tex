\tyt{Misty Mountains}
\auth{sł. J. R. R. Tolkien, opr. Peter Hollens, Tim Foust}

Far over the Misty Mountains cold\\
To dungeons deep and caverns old\\
We must awake, ere break of day,\\
To find our long forgotten gold.
\hops
The pines were roaring on the height,\\
The winds were moaning in the night.\\
The fire was red, it flaming spread;\\
The trees like torches blazed with light.
\hops
The wind was on the withered heath,\\
But in the forest stirred no leaf:\\
There shadows lay be night or day,\\
And dark things silent crept beneath.
\hops
(Aaaahh aaahh...)
\hops
The wind went on from West to East;\\
All movement in the forest ceased,\\
But shrill and harsh across the marsh\\
Its whistling voices were released.
\hops
Farewell we call to hearth and hall!\\
Though wind may blow and rain may fall,\\
We must awake ere break of day\\
Far o'er the wood and mountain tall.
