\tyt{Twiddles}
\auth{sł. Misbehavin' Maidens, sł. i muz. Janie Meneely}

Oh you hear a lot of stories 'bout the sailors and their sport\\
About how every sailor has a girl in every port\\
But if you added 2 and 2 you'd figure out right quick\\
It's just because the girls all have a lad on every ship

\refr And it's Twiddle ee ai dee ai dee ai\\

\refr It's often times a man will leave you broken with dismay\\
\refr And it's Twiddle ee ai dee ai dee ai\\
\refr Twiddle ee ai dee ei\\
\refr There's other things to twiddle when the men have sailed away

Lucky Annie was a lady who'd been pleased by many men\\
They all would sail away but then they'd come right back again\\
But if they never sailed her way she really didn't care\\
Cause I know that you don't need a man to twiddle under there

Saber had her lovers, they came in at every door\\
You could even say that she was really quite a whore\\
But when she needs some pleasing, she knows just where to go\\
I grab my good friend Madam Rouge and we go down below
\hops
There was a time when Rouge she found the sailor men a bore\\
Each new one was more tiresome than the one she had before\\
Now she finds more joy in breeches than she ever did of old\\
I'm more fond of their bulges when they're pouches full of gold
\hops
Why the boys would look at her, it puzzled poor Flint Locke\\
She would sit and smile and nod and let them brag and talk\\
But if they tried to touch her well she'd put them on the run\\
Cause why would I need a lover when I've got myself a gun
\hops
So next time you're with a lady and she takes you to her bed\\
Be sure to please her well, and remember what we've said\\
For if you do not treat her right then know that this is true\\
Us ladies all can have our fun without involving you
