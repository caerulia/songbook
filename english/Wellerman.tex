There once was a ship that put to sea\\
The name of that ship was the Billy o' Tea\\
The winds blew hard, her bow dipped down\\
Blow, me bully boys, blow (huh)

\refr Soon may the Wellerman come \tab{F C}\\
\refr To bring us sugar and tea and rum \tab{d a}\\
\refr One day, when the tonguing' is done\tab{F C}\\
\refr We'll take our leave and go \tab{E a}

She had not been two weeks from shore\\
When down on her a right whale bore\\
The captain called all hands and sworez\\
He'd take that whale in tow (huh)
\hops
\refr Soon may the Wellerman come...
\hops
Before the boat had hit the water\\
The whale's tail came up and caught her\\
All hands to the side, harpooned and fought her\\
When she dived down below (huh)
\hops
\refr Soon may the Wellerman come...
\hops
No line was cut, no whale was freed\\
An' the captain's mind was not on greed\\
But he belonged to the Whaleman's creed\\
She took that ship in tow (huh)
\hops
\refr Soon may the Wellerman come...
\hops
For forty days or even more (ooh)\\
The line went slack then tight once more\\
All boats were lost, there were only four\\
And still that whale did go
\hops
\refr Soon may the Wellerman come...
\hops
As far as I've heard, the fight's still on\\
The line's not cut, and the whale's not gone\\
The Wellerman makes his regular call\\
To encourage the captain, crew and all
\hops
\refr Soon may the Wellerman come...
