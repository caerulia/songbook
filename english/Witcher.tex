When a humble bard \tab{}\tab{a D/Fis}\\
Graced a ride along \tab{}\tab{d}\\
With Geralt of Rivia \tab{}\tab{e}\\
Along came this  song \tab{}\tab{Dsus2 e E}\\
From when the White Wolf fought\tab{a D/Fis}\\
A silver-tongued devil\tab{}\tab{d}\\
His army of elves \tab{}\tab{G}\\
At his hooves did they  revel \tab{}\tab{D/Fis G E/Gis}\hop
They came after me\tab{}\tab{a D/Fis}\\
With masterful deceit\tab{}\tab{d}\\
Broke down my lute \tab{}\tab{G}\\
And they kicked in my teeth \tab{}\tab{E7 a}\\
While the devil’s horns\tab{}\tab{a D/Fis}\\
Minced our tender meat\tab{}\tab{d}\\
And so cried the Witcher \tab{}\tab{G}\\
He can’t be bleat \tab{}\tab{G E7}\\

At the edge of the world\\
Fight the mighty horde\\
That bashes and breaks you\\
And brings you to mourn \\
He thrust every elf\\
Far back on the shelf\\
High up on the mountain\\
From whence it came \hop
He wiped out your pest\\
Got kicked in his chest\\
He’s a friend of humanity\\
So give him the rest\\
That’s my epic tale\\
Our champion prevailed\\
Defeated the villain\\
Now pour him some ale\\
