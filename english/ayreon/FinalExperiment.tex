A cry in the silence\\
A shine in the dark\\
Like a rising star\\
The dream is coming\\
Images of violence \\
A flight through time and space\\
It's such a lonely place\\
The dream has started
\hops
\refr The smoke is rising\\
\refr The vision's getting clearer\\
\refr And words become a song\\
\refr In the dreamtime
\hops
I've lost control\\
Marooned and cold\\
I suffer the fears\\
Of a future untold\\
I cannot change\\
The shape of things to come

\refr The smoke is rising\\

\refr (In the dreamtime\\
\refr The smoke is rising\\

\auth{Ayreon (The Final Experiment)}
I can smell the grass\\
And touch the flowers\\
Among the trees\\
I pass the hours\\
And fantasize\\
I let the dance of nature\\
Inspire me\\
Now my mind is free\\
From apparitions\\
I switch off like a 'television'\\
And close my eyes
\hops
\refr And I wish that I could see\\
\refr Like everybody can\\
\refr How I wish that I could be\\
\refr Like any other man
\hops
I can't see the sun\\
But I sense its glow\\
I hear the sound of water flowing\\
Down the stream\\
And my heart cries out\\
For a little bit love\\
But I know that it was not meant to be\\
So I'll fulfil my destiny\\
And accept my fate
\hops
\refr Still I wish that I could see\\
\refr Like everybody can\\
\refr How I wish that I could be\\
\refr Like any other man
