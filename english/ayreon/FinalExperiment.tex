\tyt{The Awareness (Dreamtime)}
\auth{Ayreon (The Final Experiment)}

A cry in the silence\\
A shine in the dark\\
Like a rising star\\
The dream is coming\\
Images of violence \\
A flight through time and space\\
It's such a lonely place\\
The dream has started
\hops
\refr The smoke is rising\\
\refr The vision's getting clearer\\
\refr And words become a song\\
\refr In the dreamtime
\hops
I've lost control\\
Marooned and cold\\
I suffer the fears\\
Of a future untold\\
I cannot change\\
The shape of things to come
\hops
\refr The smoke is rising\\
\refr The vision's getting clearer\\
\refr And words become a song\\
\refr In the dreamtime
\hops
\refr The smoke is rising\\
\refr The vision's getting clearer\\
\refr The hands of time are whirling around\\
\refr I'm realising\\
\refr The future's getting nearer\\
\refr And words become a song\\
\refr (In the dreamtime\\
\refr The smoke is rising\\
\refr And words become a song

\tyt{Ye Courtyard Minstrel Boy}
\auth{Ayreon (The Final Experiment)}

A new horizon\\
Hear the travellers call\\
Behold there lies a kingdom\\
Go forth ye minstrel tall\\
Sing of your wisdom\\
Spread tidings of joy\\
A feast of song and laughter\\
Ye courtyard minstrel boy
\hops
O'dance thee 'round the table\\
For conquerors and kings\\
Thou must win the heart of Gwenhwyfar\\
Fair maiden of the king\\
Thy lord thy master\\
Arthur thee so bold\\
Heed the words of Ayreon\\
And thy future will unfold
\hop
Sing ye tales of wonder\\
Whilst ye hide behind the joy\\
Cast thy spell asunder\\
Ye courtyard minstrel boy
\hops
(Sing ye, oh sing ye, courtyard minstrel boy)
\hops
A day of splendour\\
How beautiful birds sing\\
Ladies, lords and masters\\
And rainbows he would bring\\
A child's sadness\\
Sweet dreams, oh princely boy\\
Let thyn eyes reveal the madness\\
Ye courtyard minstrel boy

\tyt{Nature's Dance}
\auth{Ayreon (The Final Experiment)}
I can smell the grass\\
And touch the flowers\\
Among the trees\\
I pass the hours\\
And fantasize\\
I let the dance of nature\\
Inspire me\\
Now my mind is free\\
From apparitions\\
I switch off like a 'television'\\
And close my eyes
\hops
\refr And I wish that I could see\\
\refr Like everybody can\\
\refr How I wish that I could be\\
\refr Like any other man
\hops
I can't see the sun\\
But I sense its glow\\
I hear the sound of water flowing\\
Down the stream\\
And my heart cries out\\
For a little bit love\\
But I know that it was not meant to be\\
So I'll fulfil my destiny\\
And accept my fate
\hops
\refr Still I wish that I could see\\
\refr Like everybody can\\
\refr How I wish that I could be\\
\refr Like any other man

\tyt{The Charm Of The Seer}
\auth{Ayreon (The Final Experiment)}

I've been lost in the valley of nightmares\\
I've been found in the garden of dreams\\
Speak thy charm, I know you are out there\\
Cast thy spell and silence the screams
\hops
\refr But as I poise on the edge of life\\
\refr Where time disappears\\
\refr I bow in fear\\
\refr To the charm of the seer
\hops
I've seen fear in valiant faces\\
I've seen hope in desperate eyes\\
Lead me home to familiar places\\
Lead me back to crystalline skies
\hops
\refr And as I poise on the edge of life\\
\refr Where time disappears\\
\refr I bow in fear\\
\refr To the charm of the seer
\hops
I have failed, I have been forsaken\\
I've been scorned and misunderstood\\
I have lost, my life has been taken\\
I'd surrender if only I could
\hops
\refr And as I poise on the edge of life (the edge of life)\\
\refr Where time disappears (time disappears)\\
\refr I bow in fear\\
\refr To the charm of the seer
