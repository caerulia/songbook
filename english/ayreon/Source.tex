This fateful day, we are gathered here inside this hall\\
To find a way to escape our pending fate\\
We lack the power to immobilize the 'Frame\\
We need to save our race and leave this world behind\\
But can we leave the rest... to die
\hop
You have all been chosen for your skills and expertise\\
I beg you to have faith in me and I vow to set you free\\
I see only one solution, we have to leave this dying world\\
But I need us to collaborate and together we will find a way
\hops
\refr I found our destination near the Star of Sirrah\\
\refr A sphere drowned in water in the Alpha Pegasi\\
\refr I'll set the navigation for the Star of Sirrah\\
\refr Fire up the Starblade, are you ready for the quest to our new world
\hops
In the holy book of scripture, the Revelation of the Seals\\
It was prophesized this day would come, Armageddon was revealed\\
A Gathering of Sages, the Aligning of the Ten\\
They'll deliver us from evil and guide us to our sanctuary amid the stars
\hops
\refr I found our destination near the Star of Sirrah\\
\refr A sphere drowned in water in the Alpha Pegasi\\
\refr I'll set the navigation for the Star of Sirrah\\
\refr Fire up the Starblade, are you ready for the quest to our new world?
\hops
You realize, if we're to live on an ocean world\\
To survive, we need to change and adapt\\
Liquid Eternity allows us to evolve\\
It's the Source of our rebirth, the essence of life!
\hop
The pieces fit, we've got all we need\\
Now the puzzle is complete\\
I hope the 'Frame will allow us to escape\\
We must bid Alpha goodbye and leave our friends to die!

We've arrived at our new home we call the Bay of Dreams\\
Our abode beneath the flow of endless silver streams
\hop
Will I ever be free from the ghosts of my past\\
Will I ever succeed to find peace... at last
\hop
Overhead, a savage sky, beyond our placid bay\\
Deadly rays from Sirrah's eye, upon the seas they blaze
\hop
Will I ever adapt to this alien life\\
Will I ever feel trapped, merely trying to survive
\hops
Will you still be needing me?\\
Will you still be feeding me?\\
Will you still be heeding me?\\
Will you still let me serve when you mutate \\
Into the species roaming these oceans\\
Or will I be disengaged?
\hops
My life is winding down, as if time has ceased\\
My world grinds to a halt and nature is at peace\\
My fears are fading in the wastelands of the deep\\
My doubts all wash away by the freely twisting streams\\
in the Bay of Dreams
\hop
Far beyond in the Aftertime, a new world to come\\
In a far-off galaxy, underneath a distant sun\\
I see our children, they look like you and me\\
They await their destiny, I can almost hear their screams\\
in the Bay of Dreams

Let go, the Source will flow\\
Awaken our senses and assume control\\
Inside, the source provides \\
Nourish our spirit, dominate our minds
\hop
But deep inside our hearts\\
Hides a secret yearning\\
To a former life in a distant world in another time\\
Now a lost desire
\hop
And deep inside our minds\\
Lives a hidden longing\\
To a former life in a distant world in another time\\
But a hopeless dream\\
A desperate wish\\
A lost desire
\hops
\refr Upon the waves of eternity\\
\refr We drift away from the past\\
\refr Into an ocean of time\\
\refr To the source of life
\hop
\refr Upon the tides of infinity\\
\refr We break away from the shame\\
\refr Into a sea of relief\\
\refr To a life complete
\hops
No frame, the Source sustains\\
Feed our existence, alleviate our pain\\
Let go, The source will flow\\
Soothe our senses, assume control
