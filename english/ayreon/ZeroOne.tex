\tyt{The Truth Is In Here}

Last night I had that dream again\\
My world was black as night\\
Plagued by visions of a future world\\
(Mr L, did you take your meds?)\\
I sang about these dreams\\
Warning man of his demise\\
Wasted words that no one heard\\
(Won't you please relax? I'll make your bed)
\hop
Today I had that dream again\\
I roamed among the stars\\
On the wings of an amazing flight\\
(Mr L, do you feel OK?)\\
To a place beyond our time\\
Where the sunlight doesn't warm\\
And colour bleeds into the night\\
(We may have to increase your dose today)
\hops
\refr I know the truth is out there\\
\refr Didn't you want to see?\\
\refr I know the truth is in here\\
\refr (Why should we believe you?)\\
\refr If you want to feel
\hops
Now I have that dream again\\
I live beneath the waves\\
In a realm of grace and majesty\\
(Mr L, can I ease your mind?)\\
In the distant shadows loom\\
Cold machines rise from the deep\\
In a world once proud and free\\
(Would you free your thoughts, let it all abide)
\hop
I hate to have that dream again\\
They live inside my head\\
Feeling everything I feel inside\\
(Mr L can you please be still?)\\
They speak to me in dreams\\
They can see all I can see\\
They have always been my guide\\
(Gotta hush now, please have another pill!)
\hops
\refr I know the truth is out there\\
\refr (Why should we believe you?)\\
\refr If you want to see
\hop
\refr I know the truth is here\\
\refr (Why should we deceive you?)\\
\refr If you want to feel
\hops
(We are all alone\\
There's no one there\\
You don't have to be afraid)\\
\hop
Can't you see through this masquerade?\\
(We are all alone)\\
We are all clones\\
(There's no one there)\\
I am so scared\\
(You don't have to be afraid)
\hops
Last night I had that dream again\\
My world was black as night\\
Plagued by visions of a future world\\
(Mr L, would you take your rest?)\\
\hop
They speak to me in dreams\\
They can see all I can see\\
They have always been my guide\\
(Won't you please relax? I'll make your bed)\\

Is it too late to prevent their fall?\\
Are they ready for the key to it all?\\
The mystery solved, the answer to life\\
The final solution, a chance to survive
\hops
\refr We can save this ill-fated race\\
\refr Who are lost in the ocean of space\\
\refr Show them the way to reverse their decline\\
\refr Guide them back on a river of time
\hops
Follow the wave, speed up the flight\\
Slow down time, faster than light\\
You might let the forces take a giant leap\\
And the stream dive into the deep
\hops
We can save this ill-fated race\\
Who are lost in the ocean of space\\
Show them the way to reverse their decline\\
Guide them back on a river of time

Send back visions of war and decay.\\
Paradigms of fear in a world of dismay.\\
Shape the present, alter the past.\\
Create a new future, one that would last
