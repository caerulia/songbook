\tyt{Valley Of The Queens}
\auth{Ayreon (Into The Electric Castle)}

My journey's over\\
I'm standing on the edge\\
And close my eyes\\
To this world of lies\\
My will is broken\\
It's the end of all my dreams\\
My soul yearns\\
For the valley of the queens
\hops
My rose has withered\\
It will never bloom again\\
The soil is dry\\
Time has come to die\\
My faith has left me\\
They've stolen all my dreams\\
Oh lay me down\\
In the valley of the queens
\hops
My search has ended\\
My name is carved in stone\\
On the temple wall\\
Beyond Osiris hall\\
No holy sunrays\\
Will light my tomb of dreams\\
I won't return\\
From the valley of the queens
