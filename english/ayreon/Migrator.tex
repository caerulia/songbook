\tyt{One Small Step}
\auth{Ayreon (The Universal Migrator)}

On an early summer morning, July '69\\
As I dream of the planets\\
I hear a voice softly whisper: 'son, it is time\\
It's happening soon'
\hop
It's a quarter to four now and he carries me down\\
To our place by the telly\\
I see lights on in houses all over town\\
For the man on the Moon
\hops
\refr One small step for man\\
\refr But a giant leap for mankind\\
\refr The mighty Apollo prevailed\\
\refr The Eagle has landed
\hops
I go back to my warm bed, back to my dreams\\
But not the one of the planets\\
I decided this morning I don't want to be\\
The man on the Moon
\hops
\refr One small step for man\\
\refr But a giant leap for mankind\\
\refr The mighty Apollo prevailed\\
\refr The Eagle has landed
\hops
As I lie here in this cold tank, living a dream\\
I'm the last on the planets\\
I decided this morning I don't want to be\\
The man on Mars
\hops
\refr One small step for man\\
\refr But a giant leap for mankind\\
\refr The mighty Apollo prevailed\\
\refr The Eagle has landed

I'm standing proud\\
In this noble crowd\\
My banner raised high (The coats of arms of Amsterdam)\\
To the mystic sky (A magic light enchants the land)
\hops
\refr We're marching on\\
\refr The shooting company \\
\refr Of Captain Frans B. Cocq
\hops
My uniform shines (The livery of a high-born man)\\
The Claw-guild signs(Immortalized by the master's hand)\\
Light and shade (With colors rich and brushwork bold)\\
Night and day (With shadows black and amours gold)
\hops
\refr We're marching on\\
\refr The shooting company \\
\refr Of Captain Frans B. Cocq
\hops
I'm standing proud\\
In this noble crowd\\
In our golden age (Eternalized by the artist's hand)\\
A glorious page (In the history of our tiny land)
\hops
\refr We're marching on\\
\refr Up to the battlefield \\
\refr To where the spirits walk\\
\refr The shooting company\\

\tyt{Dragon On The Sea}
\auth{Ayreon (The Universal Migrator)}

Times are dark now, our empire's gone astray\\
Forces from down south, armada on the way\\
So we call our greatest men to run the barricade\\
Shine your light where shadows fall and wash the night away\\
\hops
\refr Sail on for your queen\\
\refr Sail into history\\
\refr You will never be the same\\
\refr Sail on for country\\
\refr Into our memory\\
\refr Time will remember your name\\
\refr Dragon on the sea
\hops
Fires burn now in once our tranquil bays\\
Tall ships that rain down thunderbolts and flames\\
Go and raise your pirate flag, cast the lines away\\
Take your fleet where darkness falls and turn the night to day
\hops
\refr Sail on for your queen\\
\refr Sail into history\\
\refr Time will remember your name\\
\refr Dragon on the sea
\hops
The sun never sets on the empire won\\
But wise men say never say never (say never)\\
It slips through our hands just like sand in sun\\
We thought it would go on forever (forever)
\hops
\refr Sail on for your queen...
\hops
Dragon ships they keep on sailing\\
on to Nova Albion\\
While the waking world is sleeping\\
Dragon ships are sailing on
