I'm trying to hold my breath \tab{}\tab{G D e}\\
Let it stay this way \tab{}\tab{C G} \\
Can't let this moment end \tab{}\tab{D}\\
You set off a dream in me \tab{}\tab{G D e}\\
Getting louder now \tab{}\tab{C G}\\
Can you hear it echoing? \tab{}\tab{D}\\
\hops
Take my hand \tab{}\tab{} \tab{e}\\
Will you share this with me? \tab{}\tab{C G}\\
'Cause darling without you \tab{}\tab{D}\\
\hops
All the shine of a thousand spotlights \tab{G}\\
All the stars we steal from the night sky \tab{D}\\
Will never be enough \tab{}\tab{a e}\\
Never be enough \tab{}\tab{C}\\
Towers of gold are still too little \tab{G}\\
These hands could hold the world but it'll \tab{D}\\
Never be enough \tab{}\tab{a e}\\
Never be enough \tab{}\tab{C}\\
\hops
For me \tab{}\tab{G}\\
Never, never\\
Never, never \tab{}\tab{D}\\
Never, for me \tab{}\tab{e C}\\
For me\\
Never enough \tab{}\tab{G}\\
Never enough \tab{}\tab{D}\\
Never enough \tab{}\tab{e}\\
For me \tab{}\tab{C}\\
For me\\
For me\\
